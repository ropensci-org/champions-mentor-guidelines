# Mentors Tools

### Infrastructure

We created a series of tools to help you in your mentoring.

- **Google Drive:** we created a Google Drive with:

  - A folder for each champion. You have access to your mentee folder
    only. This folder now has a document with your mentee application.

  - A common folder for mentors with:

    - The slides of the kick-off meeting

    - The mentor guide book

    - The slides of this training

    - The templates

- **Templates:** we created templates for your meeting with your mentee.
  There are 3 different templates: one for the first meeting, one for
  the last meeting and one for the rest of the meeting. The [*templates
  google
  doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit)
  can be copied and modified.

- **Slack:** we have two private channels for your communication with
  other mentors and with the champions:

  - **\#mentors-2023**: only mentors in this channel. You can ask
    questions, share

> resources, ask for advice from your peers. Yani is in this space to
> provide support and share information for mentors.

- **\#champions-and-mentors:** a channel with all the participants. Yani
  and Maëlle are in this channel to provide support and share common
  information.

### Tools for meetings

All our online meetings will use:

- Video conferencing software

- Collaborative notes

- Scheduling Tools

- Code of Conduct

The following list is an overview of the tools we’ll be using in our
full-cohort session (training and meetings) along with alternatives you
can use in your mentorship meetings. If you are used to using a tool
that is not in this list, you can use it (and let us know which one it
is, so we can add it to this list).

### Video Conferencing

For our Cohort Calls we will use Zoom. We will sent a calendar with the
full schedule of the program and the zoom links and meeting share
document to your email. You can add this calendar to your schedule.

For Mentorship Meetings, usually 1:1 call with your mentee, you are free
to use any tool you both agree. Here are a list of services:

- [*Zoom*](http://zoom.us/): you can also use your own Zoom rooms. The
  free account allow 40 minutes call for 1 to 1 meetings.

- [*Slack*](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack):
  Slack allow calls between the member of the workspace. You can use
  this functionality on rOpenSci Slack.

- Google Meet: if you’re using google calendar to schedule your
  mentorship calls, add a call is straightforward, click on the button
  ‘Add Google Meet video conferencing’.

- [*Jitsi:*](http://meet.jit.si/) an open source alternative. Integrates
  with Google Calendar and Slack.

- [*Skype*](http://skype.com/): works well for lower bandwidth areas.

- [*WhatsApp*](https://www.whatsapp.com/): works well for lower
  bandwidth areas.

- [*Telegram*](https://telegram.org/): also great for low bandwidth
  areas.

- [*Whereby*](https://whereby.com/): unlimited time for one-on-one
  meetings.

### Collaborative Notes

We’ll be using Google Docs for our Cohort calls. For your 1:1 mentorship
meeting notes, you’re welcome to use any collaborative note tools.

- Google Docs: To use Google Docs for your mentorship meetings, please
  create a doc in your Google Drive folder. You can make a copy of the
  template we provide.

- [*Hack.md:*](https://hackmd.io/) This is an accessible option and have
  Markdown format for the text. You can integrate with GitHub.

### Scheduling Tools

We use tools to agree on what day and time we will meet. Perhaps for
you, it is easier to agree by email, but here are a list of tool that
can help on this task (specially because time zones can be very tricky)

- [*When2meet:*](https://www.when2meet.com/) it is free, allows you to
  choose a day and time interval and create a link to fill the pool. You
  can say yes or no. It is not screen reader accessible.

- [*Doodle:*](https://doodle.com/) the free version shows ads. It is
  screen reader accessible. You choose what day and times you can use,
  and it provides a third option, which is “Maybe”. It is screen reader
  accessible.

- [*Calendly*](https://calendly.com/): you can link your calendar with
  Calendly and provide a link to other people to choose a day and time
  in your agenda. It is free for only one type of event. It also
  provides a pool option. Have a 40 spot limit and it is not screen
  reader accessible.

- Google Calendar: if you have a business plan, you can offer spots on
  your agenda for people to book with you.

- [*Time and date*](http://timeanddate.com/): for checking time zones
  and calculate dates and times.

Code of Conduct

rOpenSci is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and
harassment-free experience for everyone. We have a [*Code of
Conduct*](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) that includes the
reporting guidelines for reinforcing our CoC. Alternatively, you may
