# Mentorship Meetings

Mentorship meetings are the individual online calls you have with your
mentees.

## Collaborative notes

We ask that you keep collaborative notes for your meetings. This will
help focus your discussion and keep a record of progress. If you use
Google Docs, please create a document in the folder we created for you
and your mentee. You can make a copy of the
[*template*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit)
we provide.

## Frequency

You should be meeting with your mentees every month, we estimate at
least 30 minutes meeting. You can have more meetings if necessary, and
both can. You can agree on the schedule with your mentee.

## Meeting Tracking

We will ask you to record on this form when you hold these meetings.
This helps us to keep track and know if everything is going well.

On the meeting [*templates google
doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit)
we provide a guidance on what topics/questions you can use on each
meeting. Of course, you can choose your own structure, but it is
important to have an agenda.

#### First meeting

On the first meeting, we recommend:

- Introductions - get to know each other,

- Mentees, tell your mentor about your project

- Set 1-2 goals for your project

- Possible areas to think about:

  - *For a new package project:* a first functional version of the
    package following the recommendation of the rOpenSci development
    guide. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository,
    functionalities. Improve the developer guide (content, translations)

  - *For a package sent to review:* prepare the package to sent to the
    review process, send the package to review and complete the process.
    Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository,
    functionalities, governance. Write a paper for JOSS about the
    package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages,
    guidelines)

  - *For become a reviewer:* select a package to review. Review a
    package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages,
    guidelines)

- What do you want to see from a mentor?

#### In between meetings

For the following meetings, we recommend:

- Highlights from the past month + Recognitions (anyone to thank or
  appreciate?)

- Review goals & roadmap

  - Are we progressing? Should we adjust anywhere?

  - *\[In July/august meeting\]* Set 1-2 goals for mentee outreach
    activities

    - Analyze potential contributions by type (community call, meetups,
      conference, blog post, tutorial), by number, when, by goal
      (develop a new skill, try something new, organize something with
      other community).

- \*\[When is a month with a cohort call\]\*Review the cohort call: any
  thoughts / questions / feedback after last week’s call?

- How else can we help?

 

- Next time

#### Last meeting

For the last meeting, we recommend:

- Celebrate! Look at all you accomplished the past months!

  - Review goals from the beginning of the program. Are you where you
    thought you would be? Why or why not?

- Sprint + Mentorship & Training

  - What went well?

  - What could be better?

  - Anything we should do differently next time?
