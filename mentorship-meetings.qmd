## Collaborative notes

We ask that you keep collaborative notes for your meetings. This will help focus your discussion and keep a record of progress. If you use Google Docs, please create a document in the folder we created for you and your mentee. You can make a copy of the [*template*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit) we provide.

## Frequency

You should meet with your mentee **every month**; we estimate at least 30-minute meetings, have more sessions if necessary, and both can. You can agree on the schedule with your mentee. Check the @scheduling section to have some tools idea. 

## Meeting Tracking

We will ask you to record on [this form]() when you hold these meetings. This helps us to keep track and know if everything is going well. **You can use this form to ask for support to the rOpenSci Community Manager**.

On the meeting [*templates google doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit) we provide a guidance on what topics/questions you can use on each meeting. Of course, you can choose your own structure, but it is important to have an agenda.

#### First meeting

On the first meeting, we recommend:

-   Introductions - get to know each other,

-   Mentees, tell your mentor about your project,

-   Set 1-2 goals for your project,

-   Possible areas to think about:

    - *For a new package project:* a first functional version of the package following the recommendation of the rOpenSci development guide. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository, functionalities. Improve the developer guide (content, translations)

    - *For a package sent to review:* prepare the package to sent to the review process, send the package to review and complete the process. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository, functionalities, governance. Write a paper for JOSS about the package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages, guidelines)

    - *For become a reviewer:* select a package to review. Review a package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages, guidelines)

#### In between meetings

For the following meetings, we recommend:

-   Highlights from the past month + Recognitions (anyone to thank or appreciate?)

-   Review goals & roadmap

  -   Are we progressing? Should we adjust anywhere?

  -   **In July/August meeting** Set 1-2 goals for mentee outreach activities

        -   Analyze potential contributions by type (community call, meetups, conference, blog post, tutorial), by number, when, by goal (develop a new skill, try something new, organize something with other community).

  -   **When is a month with a cohort call**: Review the cohort call: any thoughts / questions / feedback after last weekâ€™s call?

-   How else can we help?

-   Next time

The in-between meetings can be used for peer-programing or coding sessions. 

#### Last meeting

For the last meeting, we recommend:

-   Celebrate! Look at all you accomplished the past months!

    -   Review goals from the beginning of the program. Are you where you thought you would be? Why or why not?
