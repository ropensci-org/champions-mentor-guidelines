You can access all the [traning material](https://ropensci-training.github.io/ropensci-mentors/), including the \n[*slides*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qAv8IfSMRRGbQlwOkyM7QvnYQSEvL-cUFPj72ixNgN4/edit?usp=sharing). We also shared the meeting collaborative notes pinned in the Slack channel for mentors. \n\n## Active Listening\n\nTips for active listening:\n\n- Suspend judgment and listen.\n\n- Give your full attention to the speaker (don’t rehearse what you’re\n  going to say).\n\n- Encourage the speaker with verbal and nonverbal cues.\n\n## Effective Questioning\n\nQuestions let us:\n\n- Access & analyze information.\n\n- Stimulate thinking & creativity.\n\n- Learn through discussion.\n\nSee the [*GROW*](#grow-model) model for examples.\n\n## Giving Feedback\n\nFeedback is easier to give and receive when both parties share\nexpectations about what is and isn’t in scope and about how comments\nought to be phrased.\n\nTips for giving feedback:\n\n- Try to be helpful.\n\n- Be specific. Focus on observable behavior.\n\n- Speak for yourself.\n\n- Balance praise & critical feedback: it’s important to tell people what\n  they should keep doing as well as what they should change.\n\n## GROW Model\n\n**Goal:** Agree on a topic & objective or longer-term goals.\n\n**Reality:** self-assessment, specific examples.\n\n**Options:** suggestions offered & choices made.\n\n**Way forward:** next steps.\n\nGROW model tips:\n\n- ‘Ask’ rather than ‘tell’.\n\n- Illustrate and check understanding.\n\n- Think creatively!\n\n- You don’t need to be an expert in the situation - you’re acting as a\n  facilitator.\n\nSample Questions:\n\nGOAL\n\n- What do you want to achieve?\n\n- What will be happening when you have succeeded?\n\n- GOALS can be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time\n  bound).\n\nREALITY\n\n- What is happening at the moment?\n\n- What stops you from moving on?\n\n- What have you tried?\n\n- What happened?\n\n- What have you learned?\n\nOPTIONS\n\n- What could you do? What else?\n\n- What are the advantages/ disadvantages of each option?\n\n- Would you like suggestions from me?\n\n- What options do you like the most?\n\nWAY FORWARD\n\n- What will you do?\n\n- What will be the first step?\n\n- When precisely are you going to start and finish each step?\n\n- What support do you need and from whom?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"mentorship-skills.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
