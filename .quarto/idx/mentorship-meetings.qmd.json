No face-to-face meetings are expected.\n:::\n\n## Collaborative notes\n\nWe ask that you keep collaborative notes for your meetings. This will help focus your discussion and keep a record of progress. If you use Google Docs, please create a document in the folder we created for you and your mentee. You can make a copy of the [*template*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit) we provide.\n\n## Frequency\n\nYou should meet with your mentee **every month**; we estimate at least 30-minute meetings, have more sessions if necessary, and both can. You can agree on the schedule with your mentee. Check the @scheduling section to have some tools idea. \n\n## Meeting Tracking\n\nWe will ask you to record on [this form]() when you hold these meetings. This helps us to keep track and know if everything is going well. **You can use this form to ask for support to the rOpenSci Community Manager**.\n\nOn the meeting [*templates google doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit) we provide a guidance on what topics/questions you can use on each meeting. Of course, you can choose your own structure, but it is important to have an agenda.\n\n#### First meeting\n\nOn the first meeting, we recommend:\n\n-   Introductions - get to know each other,\n\n-   Mentees, tell your mentor about your project\n\n-   Set 1-2 goals for your project\n\n-   Possible areas to think about:\n\n    - *For a new package project:* a first functional version of the package following the recommendation of the rOpenSci development guide. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository, functionalities. Improve the developer guide (content, translations)\n\n    - *For a package sent to review:* prepare the package to sent to the review process, send the package to review and complete the process. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository, functionalities, governance. Write a paper for JOSS about the package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages, guidelines)\n\n    - *For become a reviewer:* select a package to review. Review a package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages, guidelines)\n\n-   What do you want to see from a mentor?\n\n#### In between meetings\n\nFor the following meetings, we recommend:\n\n-   Highlights from the past month + Recognitions (anyone to thank or appreciate?)\n\n-   Review goals & roadmap\n\n  -   Are we progressing? Should we adjust anywhere?\n\n  -   **In July/August meeting** Set 1-2 goals for mentee outreach activities\n\n        -   Analyze potential contributions by type (community call, meetups, conference, blog post, tutorial), by number, when, by goal (develop a new skill, try something new, organize something with other community).\n\n  -   **When is a month with a cohort call**: Review the cohort call: any thoughts / questions / feedback after last weekâ€™s call?\n\n-   How else can we help?\n\n-   Next time\n\nThe in-between meetings can be used for peer-programing or coding sessions. \n\n#### Last meeting\n\nFor the last meeting, we recommend:\n\n-   Celebrate! Look at all you accomplished the past months!\n\n    -   Review goals from the beginning of the program. Are you where you thought you would be? Why or why not?\n\n-   Sprint + Mentorship & Training\n\n    -   What went well?\n\n    -   What could be better?\n\n    -   Anything we should do differently next time?\n\n-   Next steps\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"mentorship-meetings.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
