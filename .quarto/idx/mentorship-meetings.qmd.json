Of course, you can choose your own structure, but it is\nimportant to have an agenda.\n\n#### First meeting\n\nOn the first meeting, we recommend:\n\n- Introductions - get to know each other,\n\n- Mentees, tell your mentor about your project\n\n- Set 1-2 goals for your project\n\n- Possible areas to think about:\n\n  - *For a new package project:* a first functional version of the\n    package following the recommendation of the rOpenSci development\n    guide. Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository,\n    functionalities. Improve the developer guide (content, translations)\n\n  - *For a package sent to review:* prepare the package to sent to the\n    review process, send the package to review and complete the process.\n    Improve functions, testing, documentation, repository,\n    functionalities, governance.

Review a\n    package. Improve the review process (accessibility, languages,\n    guidelines)\n\n- What do you want to see from a mentor?\n\n#### In between meetings\n\nFor the following meetings, we recommend:\n\n- Highlights from the past month + Recognitions (anyone to thank or\n  appreciate?)\n\n- Review goals & roadmap\n\n  - Are we progressing? Should we adjust anywhere?\n\n  - *\\[In July/august meeting\\]* Set 1-2 goals for mentee outreach\n    activities\n\n    - Analyze potential contributions by type (community call, meetups,\n      conference, blog post, tutorial), by number, when, by goal\n      (develop a new skill, try something new, organize something with\n      other community).\n\n- \\*\\[When is a month with a cohort call\\]\\*Review the cohort call: any\n  thoughts / questions / feedback after last week’s call?\n\n- How else can we help?\n\n \n\n- Next time\n\n#### Last meeting\n\nFor the last meeting, we recommend:\n\n- Celebrate!
