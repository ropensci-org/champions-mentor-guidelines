You have access to your mentee folder\n    only. This folder now has a document with your mentee application.\n\n  - A common folder for mentors with:\n\n    - The slides of the kick-off meeting\n\n    - The mentor guide book\n\n    - The slides of this training\n\n    - The templates\n\n- **Templates:** we created templates for your meeting with your mentee.\n  There are 3 different templates: one for the first meeting, one for\n  the last meeting and one for the rest of the meeting. The [*templates\n  google\n  doc*](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1vjmfbjv9ABJ6fkbtQRMFPydJZ3ypKOIpZ-xf7_iBhvo/edit)\n  can be copied and modified.\n\n- **Slack:** we have two private channels for your communication with\n  other mentors and with the champions:\n\n  - **\\#mentors-2023**: only mentors in this channel. You can ask\n    questions, share\n\n> resources, ask for advice from your peers. Yani is in this space to\n> provide support and share information for mentors.\n\n- **\\#champions-and-mentors:** a channel with all the participants. Yani\n  and Maëlle are in this channel to provide support and share common\n  information.\n\n### Tools for meetings\n\nAll our online meetings will use:\n\n- Video conferencing software\n\n- Collaborative notes\n\n- Scheduling Tools\n\n- Code of Conduct\n\nThe following list is an overview of the tools we’ll be using in our\nfull-cohort session (training and meetings) along with alternatives you\ncan use in your mentorship meetings. If you are used to using a tool\nthat is not in this list, you can use it (and let us know which one it\nis, so we can add it to this list).\n\n### Video Conferencing\n\nFor our Cohort Calls we will use Zoom. We will sent a calendar with the\nfull schedule of the program and the zoom links and meeting share\ndocument to your email. You can add this calendar to your schedule.\n\nFor Mentorship Meetings, usually 1:1 call with your mentee, you are free\nto use any tool you both agree. Here are a list of services:\n\n- [*Zoom*](http://zoom.us/): you can also use your own Zoom rooms. The\n  free account allow 40 minutes call for 1 to 1 meetings.\n\n- [*Slack*](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack):\n  Slack allow calls between the member of the workspace. You can use\n  this functionality on rOpenSci Slack.\n\n- Google Meet: if you’re using google calendar to schedule your\n  mentorship calls, add a call is straightforward, click on the button\n  ‘Add Google Meet video conferencing’.\n\n- [*Jitsi:*](http://meet.jit.si/) an open source alternative.

You\n  can say yes or no. It is not screen reader accessible.\n\n- [*Doodle:*](https://doodle.com/) the free version shows ads. It is\n  screen reader accessible. You choose what day and times you can use,\n  and it provides a third option, which is “Maybe”. It is screen reader\n  accessible.\n\n- [*Calendly*](https://calendly.com/): you can link your calendar with\n  Calendly and provide a link to other people to choose a day and time\n  in your agenda. It is free for only one type of event. It also\n  provides a pool option. Have a 40 spot limit and it is not screen\n  reader accessible.\n\n- Google Calendar: if you have a business plan, you can offer spots on\n  your agenda for people to book with you.\n\n- [*Time and date*](http://timeanddate.com/): for checking time zones\n  and calculate dates and times.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nrOpenSci is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and\nharassment-free experience for everyone.
