# Introduction

## Welcome!

Thank you for volunteering to be a mentor for the [rOpenSci Champions
Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/).

We develop this guide to help you to navigate the logistics of the
program and provide tools for your role as _mentor_.

As a living document we build together, we are always grateful for
feedback, improvements and contributions.

## Role Description

Mentors will play a vital role in the rOpenSci Champions Program by
advising and inspiring their mentees. Mentors will also connect their
mentees to people, programs, and organizations; recommend, resources,
readings, training, and experiences; and provide feedback on the
menteeâ€™s project.

You will work with Champions to develop their project, which can be one
of the following options:

- Create a new package;


- Go through the review process with an R package they have already
  developed;


- Serve as a reviewer for the rOpenSci software peer review system.

Mentors may also support Champions with delivering other activities
including: giving a talk, writing blog posts, and teaching other
community members.
